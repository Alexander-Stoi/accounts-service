# Homework

- Create a backend for a Blog with Express following the MVC pattern.
- You can either use your own FE, or use Postman, or use EJS.
- There should be an /auth route that handles login
- There should be a /posts routes that handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE calls

# Bonus
- Users should have a role property, that can either be 'Admin' or 'User'
- Add a middleware that checks the role of the current user and make it so that only admins can make PUT and DELETE requests.
